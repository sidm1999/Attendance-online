Up until then, files were either kept on spools of magnetic tape or on good old-fashioned paper, with no way to jump right to the record you wanted to pull up. With the RAMAC, a mechanical arm would retrieve data by storing data at a particular magnetic orientation. This technology goes on to be used (at a smaller size) in laptops and computer servers everywhere.</p><br><br><br><br>' ,

Two years later, more than half a million American women are taking Enovid—and not all of them have cramps.

Telstar makes real a 1945 concept by science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, who envisioned a global communications network based on geosynchronous satellites.

As the earliest iteration of a computer-aided design (CAD) program, Sketchpad pioneered the use of geometric constraints (fixing the length of a line or an angle between two segments).

The physical effect that MRIs rely on—nuclear magnetic resonance—earns various scientists Nobel Prizes for physics in 1944 and 1952. Many believe that Raymond Damadian establishes the machine\'s medical merit in 1973, when he first uses magnetic resonance to discern healthy tissue from cancer. Yet, in 2003, the Nobel Prize for medicine goes to Peter Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield for their "seminal discoveries."

By its 10-year anniversary, Facebook averages 1.23 billion monthly users—17 percent of the entire global population. And in 2018, Zuckerberg is called to testify in front of the U.S. Congress about how hacked personal data from the site and targeted Facebook ads were leveraged to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.</p><br><br><br><br><br>' ,

Two years later, Google adds Street View, sending cars, trekkers, and bots around the world in an effort to let users see 360-degree street-level views of houses, roads, and landmarks. An app version of Google Maps is also included on the first iPhone—reportedly commissioned by Tim Cook mere weeks before launch when he realized the Apple prototype wouldn’t cut it.<br><br><span class="span">Honorable Invention : </span> YouTube</p><br><br>' ,

It’s both more immersive and more physically demanding than previous generations of video games, no matter what your parents say, and an important step toward synthesizing real-world and virtual activity.</p><br><br><br><br><br>' ,

The iPhone is also the first U.S. smartphone without a physical keypad, and goes on to become the best-selling gadget ever, with more than 1.2 billion sold to date, and drives the development of app-based companies like Uber, Venmo, Tinder, Snapchat—and Postmates, which will indeed deliver Starbucks.<br><br><span class="span">Honorable Invention : </span> Kindle</p><br><br><br><br>' ,
'<img src="inventions/hadroncollider.jpg" class="set" align="left" /><br><br><h2 align="center" class="white"/> 2008: Large Hadron Collider<\h2> <br> <p align="left" class="para" /> Ten years in the making at the European Organization for Energy Research (CERN), the LHC opens in 2008 as the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator, capable of propelling energy beams at close to the speed of light. In 2012, tests at the LHC will reveal evidence of the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle believed to be instrumental in creating mass—and therefore one of the building blocks of the universe. Peter Higgs, the particle’s namesake (and who disapproves of its being nicknamed “The God Particle”), wins the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for this advancement in scientific understanding of the properties of matter.</p><br><br><br>' ,

Bitcoin uses blockchain computing to decentralize and verify payments, and is nearly tamper- (and explanation-) proof. To avoid inflation, the total number of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. The amount of the currency in circulation increases as more are “mined," a computing process that uses enormous amounts of power. The value of the currency peaks in December 2017, with one Bitcoin worth over $19,000 USD.</p><br><br><br><br>' ,

Although Siri 1.0 is buggy and has difficulty understanding some voices and accents, it’s officially integrated into the iPhone 4S in October 2011, and has since been updated to include more languages, better speech-recognition software, and a British-accent option. Siri presages the swift introduction of more voice-activated virtual assistants, like Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana (both 2014).<br><br><span class="span">Honorable Invention : </span> iPad</p><br><br>' ,

The rover’s goal is to investigate environmental conditions on Mars and determine whether it will be suitable for microbial (and thus, perhaps, human) life. It is the most advanced rover to ever land on Mars, and can collect detailed imagery and environmental samples to analyze and send back to Earth.</p><br><br><br><br>' ,

These advances arguably push the tech industry into a more serious pursuit of artificial intelligence and machine learning projects—including self-driving car technology, facial recognition software (Face ID and automatic tagging on Facebook), and technology that will help voice assistants like Alexa get smarter over time.<br><br><span class="span">Honorable Invention : </span> DJI Phantom Drone</p><br><br><br>' ,

It\'s a story of incredible bravery on behalf of many who battled the disease, but one little device arrived at just the right time to help out the cause—the hemopurifier. With Time listing the device as one of the best inventions of 2014, the magazine says the device works by using a "specially designed cartridge that attaches to a dialysis machine," essentially sucking the ebola virus from blood. The device also works to combat hepatitis and cancer.</p><br><br><br><br>' ,

Multiuse rockets could dramatically reduce the still-hefty cost of space travel, which SpaceX’s partnership with NASA had already lowered. The Falcon 9 launch is touted by SpaceX founder Elon Musk as a step toward his ultimate goal of colonizing Mars—which we might need to do sooner than expected.</p><br><br><br><br><br>' ,

High-resolution screens on the inside of the goggles project stereoscopic images to mimic normal sight and convince the user’s brain that they’re seeing something real, even if that something is an enormous killer robot. While the headset is primarily intended as a gaming add-on, it’s subsequently adapted for uses as disparate as medical education and driver training. Facebook, however, cancels production of the second-generation Rift in late 2018.</p><br><br><br>' ,

Among them are generation IV fission reactors, an evolution of traditional designs; small modular reactors; and fusion reactors, a technology that has seemed eternally just out of reach. Developers of generation IV fission designs, such as Canada’s Terrestrial Energy and Washington-based TerraPower, have entered into R&D partnerships with utilities, aiming for grid supply (somewhat optimistically, maybe) by the 2020s.</p><br><br><br>' ,
